# for this project, we should first think about the aspects of a library and its functions.
# A library has available books for lending, they let students borrow and return books.
# so we should set up 2 classes: Library and Student


class Library:
    # stores books that are available to borrow
    def __init__(self, booklist):
        self.availableBooks = booklist

    # shows the available books to user
    def displayBooks(self):
        print("\nThe books we have in stock are:")
        for book in self.availableBooks:
            print(book)

    # method for lending out books
    def lendBooks(self, reqBook):
        if reqBook in self.availableBooks:
            print(f"\nYou have successfully borrowed '{reqBook}'")
            self.availableBooks.remove(reqBook)
        #     update the books which are available
        else:
            print("\nSorry, we do not have this book at the moment.")

    # method for returning books
    def returnBook(self, returnBook):
        self.availableBooks.append(returnBook)
        print(f"\nThank you for returning '{returnBook}'!")


class Student:
    # method for students asking to borrow books
    def requestBook(self):
        reqBook = input("Enter the name of the book you would like to borrow: ")
        return reqBook

    # method for students returning books
    def returnBook(self):
        returnBook = input("Enter the name of the book you are returning: ")
        return returnBook
